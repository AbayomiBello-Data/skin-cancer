**Skin Cancer Classification Using DenseNet-121**
**This project implements and deploys a skin cancer classification model based on the research paper "Skin Cancer Classification Using Fine-Tuned Transfer Learning of DENSENET-121" by Abayomi Bello, Man Fai Leung, and Vanessa Sin Chun Ng (2024, Applied Sciences).**

The model utilizes DenseNet-121, fine-tuned with custom dense layers and enhanced with preprocessing techniques including hair removal, lighting normalization, and data augmentation. It classifies dermoscopic images into benign or malignant categories with high accuracy.

The project includes:

A trained DenseNet-121 model fine-tuned for binary skin cancer classification.

A user-friendly web interface to upload and classify skin lesion images.

Deployment-ready code using Streamlit

Preprocessing pipeline based on techniques described in the original paper.
